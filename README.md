[![Build Status](https://github.com/joshday/QGIS.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/joshday/QGIS.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)


This package uses the [command line processing](https://docs.qgis.org/3.34/en/docs/user_manual/processing/standalone.html) utilities of QGIS to run geoprocessing tasks from Julia.  QGIS.jl is unaffiliated with the [QGIS](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS) project.
